# testing-rl
Scripts to test various reinforcement learning algorithms on simple control problems.

***This is a work-in-progress...***

To start off, I'm trying out some of the [Stable Baselines](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/) implementations of RL algorithms using Tensorflow.

I'm testing them on some new environments I created in OpenAI's [Gym](https://gym.openai.com) toolkit.  To check these out, see my other repo:
